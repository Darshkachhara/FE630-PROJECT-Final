# FE630-PROJECT-Final

A Factor Model Based Allocation

This project aims to understand, analyze, and compare the behavior of the Long/Short Macro Strategy, using the French Fama 3-Factor model, with factors momentum, value, and size. It is aimed to calculate the portfolioâ€™s sensitivity to different lengths of look-back periods and target beta during several historical periods: before the subprime (2008) crisis, during that crisis, and after the crisis.

For practical considerations, the project assumes that the universe of investment is a set of ETFs large enough to represent the World global economy. The benchmark in this project is S&P 500 Index, which SPY represents. The ETFs are listed as below:

1. CurrencyShares Euro Trust (FXE)
2. iShares MSCI Japan Index (EWJ)
3. SPDR GOLD Trust (GLD)
4. Powershares NASDAQ-100 Trust (QQQ) 5. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)
6. iShares Lehman Short Treasury Bond (SHV) 7. PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (DBA)
8. United States Oil Fund LP (USO)
9. SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI)
10. iShares S&P Latin America 40 Index (ILF)
11. iShares MSCI Pacific ex-Japan Index Fund (EPP) 12. SPDR DJ Euro Stoxx 50 (FEZ)

About the Strategy

The Fama French 3-factor model is an asset pricing model that expands on the capital asset pricing model by adding size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factors.
The Fama and French model has three factors: the size of firms, book-to-market values, and excess return on the market.
The model is essentially the result of an econometric regression of historical stock prices.
